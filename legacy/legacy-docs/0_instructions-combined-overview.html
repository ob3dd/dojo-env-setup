<h1>Installation Overview</h1>
<p><strong>In Stack 4: Data Enrichment, you will use new tools on your computer that will require a local installation
		of Python</strong> instead of Google Colab. Please complete these installation steps <strong>by the beginning of
		Stack 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>These steps should take ~30-90 minutes,</strong> depending on the speed of your machine and internet
		connection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By the end of this chapter, you will:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li> Install GitHub Desktop,</li>
	<li> Install Python via Anaconda (or via miniforge - if on a Mac with an Apple Chip)</li>
	<li> Create a special Python environment (dojo-env)</li>
	<li>Supercharge Jupyter Notebooks with Extensions</li>
	<li> Install Visual Studio Code.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Currently Supported Operating Systems</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We have prepared environment files (.yml files) for 4 different OS configurations:
		<ul>
			<li>Windows (10 &amp; 11)</li>
			<li>Mac (with Intel processors)*</li>
			<li>Mac (Apple Chips)*</li>
			<li>Linux**</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>*Note for Mac users - if you don't know which type of Mac you have :</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Check the "About this Mac" screen for your computer. <ul>
				<li>Click on the Apple symbol on the top-left corner of your screen.</li>
				<li><strong>Click About This Mac. </strong></li>
				<li>A window with your computer's specs will appear like the one in the screenshot below<ul>
						<li><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1656714456__About this Mac -Intel.png"

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If it has a "Processor" line that says "Intel" you should follow the Instructions: Mac (Intel
					Processor).
				</li>
				<li>If it has a "Chip" line that says "Apple" then you should follow the Instructions: Mac (Apple Chip).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>**Note to Linux Users:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Our Linux installation instructions are still in beta. While they have successfully been installed on
			students' Linux machines, we currently do not have a Linux machine available for troubleshooting.</li>
		<li>If you run into issues during installation, contact your instructor and send an email to
			jirving@codingdojo.com requesting assistance in with your the Linux version of dojo-env.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
	<ul>
